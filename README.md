# Nostale pond minigame bot

A simple bot to play pond minigame that uses image recognition system (so it is very probably that this code would only work on my pc :( )  
based in cv2, pyautogui and numpy libraries

I made it with my laptopn with Windows OS where the screen scale was at 125% and nostale resolution at 1024x768.

If you only want to catch basic fishes run the nostaleScript.py, for bonus run nostaleScript2.py and for totally automated bot run both scripts with fishScript.py

This bot is not optimized, I made it for fun and it works, but at the expense of the CPU. You can play with the code and its variables and try to optimize it
by yourself
